what is a neural network?

a network of nodes <- graph structure
the nodes need to be able to communicate with each other -> send each other scalar values
the nodes need to be able to transform the values they are given -> plug in a function

Nodes:
    output value
    function
    neighbors
    weighted edges
        

in a fully connected network, each layer needs to compute its output value before the next layer can begin computing

how will the neurons be stored?
    - a list per layer

each node is responsible for sending the weighted output to each node in the next layer it is connected to
